# Vegard's CHAT
Small command line chat program written in Go. This is in no way a finished or secure program. I would not recommend using it outside your own network.

## Running the program
Make sure you have <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Go installed</a>.<br>

## 1.
```git clone https://github.com/vegardalvsaker/chat```

## 2
``` cd chat```

## 3
```go run server.go```

## 4
```go run client.go```

and follow instructions in client.
